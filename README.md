#Lyapunov Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Feedback Control Policies

This repository contains the implementation of the Lyapunov neural ODE for learning control policies. Two case studies are highlighted: double integrator, atmospheric pressure plasma jet. For further case studies, refer to the extra_case_studies folder.
